                       Consider a parking lot with 48 available spaces
10 large regular spaces, 24 medium regular spaces, 9 small regular spaces, and 5 medium handicapped spaces.

                                //following order of vehicles
                                
 //handicapped must be parked first 
 //small vehicle can park in small, medium and large space while medium can park in medium and large space

                              //parking lot should not be full
