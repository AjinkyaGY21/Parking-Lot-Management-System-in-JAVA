# Parking Lot Management System

The Parking Lot Management System is a Java-based application that simulates the operations of a parking lot. It allows vehicles to be parked in available spaces based on their size and type. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and provides a foundation for managing a parking lot efficiently.

## Features

- Different sizes of parking spaces: Small, Medium, and Large
- Vehicle types: Regular and Handicapped
- Parking algorithm that prioritizes handicapped parking and accommodates different vehicle sizes
- Tracking of available parking spaces based on size and type
- Check if the parking lot is full
- Display the count of available parking spots for each size and type of vehicle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Parking Lot Management System, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above
- Any Java IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code)
